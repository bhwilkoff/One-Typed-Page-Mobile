# One Typed Page Mobile Viewer

A mobile-optimized web application for viewing and interacting with [One Typed Page](https://onetypedpage.com/) - Daniel Marleau's daily typewriting project.

## üìñ About One Typed Page

One Typed Page is a commitment by Daniel Marleau to type one page every day on a manual typewriter. Each page is typed once, with no corrections, no edits, no spell-check. What you see is what came out of the typewriter, mistakes and all. It's about embracing imperfection and finding beauty in the process.
